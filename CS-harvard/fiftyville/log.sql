        162  Eugene   2023  7      28   I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recogniz
                                        ed. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emmas bakery,
                                        I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thie
                                        f there withdrawing some money.

        163  Raymond  2023  7      28   As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who
                                        talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard
                                        the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest
                                        flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the
                                        person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight
                                        ticket.
